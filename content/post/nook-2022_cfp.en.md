After a two-year break, the [Night of Open Knowledge](https://2022.nook-luebeck.de/) will take place again on November 11 and 12, 2022 at the Audimax of the University of Lübeck. The organization has started and you can [submit your talk or workshop now](https://2022.nook-luebeck.de/cfp/)!

In 2019, the NooK took place for the last time. Back then with about 300 visitors for the first time on two days, on Friday evening and Saturday starting in the afternoon.

The event remains the same: We are planning the Nook for Friday the 11th of November and Saturday the 12th of November. You can find all the details about the event, the Code of Conduct, an F.A.Q. on submissions, and much, much more on the [Night of Open Knowledge website](https://2022.nook-luebeck.de/).

We hope to receive numerous submissions from many exciting subject areas. In the last years it went from computer science to nutrition science, from psychology to archaeology in Mongolia. We are looking forward to what you will fascinate us with this time!

Talks of the last years can be found on [media.ccc.de](https://media.ccc.de/search/?q=metanook) or [YouTube.com](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCg-78JJp_D3f7H6QRuZRoAA).
